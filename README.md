# Fourier series

## Author: Ammar Abul-Feilat

This is a simple implementation of the Fourier series. The code is written in JS and uses the following libraries:

- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)

## Usage

The code is written in JS and can be run in any browser. To run the code, simply open the `index.html` file in your browser. The code can also be run using a local server

## Examples

The following are some examples of the output of the code:

**_Note:_** visualize a Fourier series for a square wave in JavaScript with p5.js , the equation for the Fourier series is given by:

```js
f(x)= 4/π ∑n=1,3,5...∞1n sin(nπx)
```
